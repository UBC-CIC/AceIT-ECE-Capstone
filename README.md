# AceIT

This project was built for the UBC Cloud Innovation Centre as a part of the UBC ECE Capstone course.

AceIT is a chat-based AI assistant leverages AWS technologies to deliver personalized study tips and summaries to students, and providing instructors with valuable analytics to improve curriculum delivery. The system integrates with Canvas LMS from which it retrives course information as its sources.
