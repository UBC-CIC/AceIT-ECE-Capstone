This leads to heavy rainfall and floods in regions like South America and droughts in Southeast Asia and Australia.\n   * La Niña is the opposite of El Niño, with stronger trade winds pushing cold water westward. This results in drier conditions in the Americas and wetter conditions in Southeast Asia and Australia.\n2.3 Ocean Currents and Storm Development\nOcean currents influence the intensity and frequency of tropical storms and hurricanes by determining the temperature of surface waters. Warm ocean waters provide the energy necessary to fuel these storms, while cooler waters suppress their development.\n* Hurricanes and Cyclones:\n   * Tropical storms, such as hurricanes in the Atlantic and cyclones in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, form over warm ocean waters where temperatures exceed 26.5°C (79.7°F).\n   * As ocean currents distribute heat, regions with persistent warm waters, like the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, are more likely to experience frequent and powerful hurricanes.\n   * Conversely, cold currents can suppress hurricane formation by reducing the amount of heat available to these storms.\n________________'}, {'documentName': 'Human Impact on Weather and Climate.txt', 'sourceUrl': 'https://15.157.251.49/files/114/download?download_frd=1&verifier=55ucI3rYpzOOBWnnsurHCAA2YycwJAkm3KqA7mfM', 'documentContent': '* Urban Heat Island Effect:\n Urbanization contributes to the urban heat island effect, where cities experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to the concentration of buildings, roads, and human activity.
